    <p>Welcome to the matrix multiplication utility.</p>
    <p>
      First of all, use the input fields and the range/slider to select the
      dimensions of the 2 matrices.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you change the dimensions, you will notice the the two matrices below
      (Matrix A and Matrix B) will change size.
    </p>
    <p>Once you are done with the above, it's time to enter your values.</p>
    <p>
      You may notice that each matrix is initialised with all values = 1, you
      can change the values yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are satisfied with the values, you can click "Multiply!" and you
      will see the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result doesn't show integers, the values are displayed in the same way
      as the column numbering in Microsoft Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to execute a new multiplication, click "New Multiplication"
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
